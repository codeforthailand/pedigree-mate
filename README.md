Pedigree Mate is created in cooperation with Poultry Research And Development Center Kabinburi. The goal of this application is to display mating pairs, such as couples of chicken, that have common ancestors. With this information, staff can verify and try to select mating pairs that have no overlapping ancestors. This process is very crucial in developing local breeds for a certain environment, such as Thailand.
